      This project scans the input URL and runs it through a few machine learning algorithms to scan it and separate legitimate URLs from fake URLs. 
      The input URL after being scanned is given a probability score (in the form of %). 
      This probability score has a threshold of 70%. If the score is above 70%, then the URL is highly likely to lead to a phishing attempt. 
      Whereas if the score is under 70%, the URL is more inclined to be safe.
